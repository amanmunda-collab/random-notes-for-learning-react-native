 @/constant (Alias/Absolute Imports) 🎯
The @/constant syntax is an example of an Absolute Import that relies on a Path Alias (or path mapping) configured in your project's settings. This is not a standard JavaScript feature but is enabled by build tools.

Usage and Explanation
What it means: The @ symbol (or another symbol like ~) is mapped to a specific base directory in your project, regardless of where the importing file is located.

When to use it: For imports that reference code in a common, top-level directory like src, constants, lib, or assets.

Why it's used:

Clarity: Imports are short and clean (@/constant instead of ../../../../constant).

Refactoring Ease: If you move the importing file, the import path doesn't have to change.

Example Configuration (e.g., in a tsconfig.json or jsconfig.json)
To make @/ work, you must tell your compiler/bundler where @/ points to:

JSON

// Example in tsconfig.json (for TypeScript/VS Code)
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "baseUrl": ".", // Base directory for absolute imports
    "paths": {
      "@/*": ["src/*"] // MAPPING: '@/' maps to 'src/' folder
    }
  }
}
Example Usage
If the file structure is the same as before, and the alias maps @/ to the src/ folder:

src/ (Base for @/)
├── components/
│   └── Header/
│       └── Header.js (Currently here)
└── constants/
    └── index.js
In Header.js, you can now import from any file under src/ using the alias:

JavaScript

import { API_URL } from '@/constants'; // The path starts from 'src/'
This makes the import path look the same no matter how deep Header.js is nested.
